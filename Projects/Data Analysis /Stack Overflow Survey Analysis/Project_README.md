# Developer Survey Data Analysis Project

## Project Objective

This project aims to analyze the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data to gain insights into various aspects of the developer community. The primary objectives of this analysis are to determine popular programming languages, assess the prevalence of Python among developers, identify the most popular learning methods, and explore the impact of having a master's degree on job prospects.

## Key Achievements

1. **Popular Programming Languages:** Explored the survey data to identify the most popular programming languages among developers, helping to understand the technology landscape in the developer community.

2. **Python Usage:** Calculated the percentage of developers using Python, shedding light on the popularity and adoption of Python in the programming world.

3. **Learning Methods:** Investigated the preferred learning methods among developers, providing insights into how developers acquire new skills and knowledge.

4. **Impact of Master's Degree:** Analyzed the relationship between having a master's degree and the likelihood of getting a job as a developer, offering insights into the role of education in career prospects.

## Skills Used

- **Python Programming:** Utilized Python programming to perform data analysis tasks, including data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.

- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaned and preprocessed the survey data to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.

- **Data Visualization:** Created visualizations such as bar plots and pie charts to effectively communicate findings and trends.

- **Pandas:** Employed the Pandas library for data manipulation, exploration, and aggregation.

- **Matplotlib:** Used Matplotlib to generate visualizations for a better understanding of the survey data.
