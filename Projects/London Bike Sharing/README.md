# London Bike Sharing Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the London Bike Sharing Data Analysis project repository. In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of London's bike-sharing dataset, exploring trends, weather impacts, and seasonal patterns. Below, you'll find an overview of the project and how to replicate it.

## Project Overview
- Tableau Visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/griffin.bohannon/viz/LondonBikeRides_16955885083760/Dashboard1

- **Objective:** Analyze London bike sharing data to provide insights and inform decision-making.
- **Data Source:** Kaggle London Bike Sharing Dataset.
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas), Tableau.
- **GitHub Repository:** [Link to Repository](#)

## Key Achievements

1. **Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:**
   - Programmatically obtained the dataset using Kaggle's API.
   - Cleaned and enhanced the data for analysis.
   - Exported the refined dataset to Excel as "London Bikes Final."

2. **Tableau Visualizations:**
   - Created five informative visualizations in Tableau.
   - Highlighted the total number of bike rides and a customizable Simple Moving Average chart.
   - Visualized temperature versus wind speed relationships using a heatmap.

3. **Interactive Tooltips:**
   - Implemented interactive tooltips for additional visuals.
   - Enabled users to explore bike ride details by weather and hour, enhancing user experience.
